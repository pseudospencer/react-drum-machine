# About

This application is a simple drum machine that I built while working towards the Free Code Camp Frontend Libraries Certification. You can see the [Project Requirements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) here.

## Tech Stack

I bootstrapped the application with with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## Features

* The drum machine has 9 samples.
* Each sample is mapped to a 'drum pad' that can be triggered by clicking the UI element or by pressing the associated key.
* Triggering a sample updates the display with the sample name.
